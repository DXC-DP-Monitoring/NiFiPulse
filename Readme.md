# NiFiPulse
We chose this name as we beleive it reflects the essence of our capstone project with ArkXJobInTech and DXC.
**NiFiPulse** is a lightweight on-prem monitoring and alerting solution for Apache NiFi clusters.  
It continuously tracks system and pipeline health: CPU, RAM, disk usage, file I/O, NiFi pipeline metrics, and more, then triggers alerts when thresholds are exceeded.

## Features

- 📊 **Metrics Collection** – Gather CPU, RAM, file system, and NiFi flow stats.  
- 🧩 **NiFi Integration** – Connects directly with NiFi APIs to pull processor and queue metrics.  
- ⚠️ **Alerting Engine** – Send email, Slack, or webhook alerts based on user-defined thresholds.  
- 🧠 **Custom Dashboards** – Visualize health trends and performance over time.  
- 🛠️ **On-Prem Ready** – Designed for environments without external cloud dependencies.  
- 🔐 **Secure Configuration** – Credentials and endpoints are managed via `.env` files.
